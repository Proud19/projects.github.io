Hello, my name is **Proud Mpala**. I am a Computer Science student at Stanford University, specializing in **Compilers and AI**. My academic journey is driven by a deep interest in **systems, compilers, and machine learning**.





## 📚 Education  
- **Stanford University** (B.S in Computer Science, [Systems Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/bachelors-compsci-tracks-overview))
- **Stanford University** (M.S. in Computer Science, [AI Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/masters-specializations/ms-program-sheets))  


## 🏗️ Projects  
I’ve worked on a range of projects in **systems programming, AI, networking, iOS, and WebApps**. 
### Systems Projects 
Working on Computer Systems was most eye opening and yet rewarding experience. The first major system I worked on was [Cool Compiler](projects/cool-compiler.md) there by gaining understanding on how computers translate human readable code into machine code. I next worked on [PintOS](projects/cool-compiler.md) which gave me an indepth experience on building threads, virtual memory, filesystem and see it all come together. I also had the pleasure of imiplemeting the [TCP/IP Stack](projects/tcp-ip-stack.md) to understand how computing devices talk to each other over networks. We all do get that adrenaline rush when things go fast right, I think computers do to; I worked on making things go super fast on computers using by exploiting GPUs. Most notably [Cuda Renderer](projects/cuda-renderer.md) for fast drawing of graphics using GPU.


### AI and ML projects 
Building and learning about AI systems gave me an understanding of the recent applications of computation and mathematics. I worked on building [an AI for one of friends' favorite activities](projects/geoguessrai.md), GeoGuessr. With the advent of language models, I decided to learn a little bit about them and ended up contributing to [optimization techniques for Language Models](projects/minbert.md). I found it also important to understand the harms associated with AI and ML models. This culminated in exploring potential harm in [using AI for hiring procedures](projects/algorithmic-fairness.md) as well as [analyzing the alignment of Large Language Models through Knowledge Graphs](llm-through-kg.md).

## 📝 Research & Publications  
I have contributed to research on **LLM safety, adversarial optimization, and knowledge graphs**.  
- [**Measuring Model Safety through Knowledge Graphs**](publications/model-safety.md) – Developed a framework for evaluating AI model safety.  
- [**SMART for MinBERT**](publications/minbert.md) – Implemented adversarial regularization techniques to improve fine-tuning robustness.  
- [More publications →](publications.md)  

## 🎓 Teaching & Leadership  
I serve as a **Teaching Assistant & Course Assistant** for Stanford’s core CS courses:  
- [CS106A/B](teaching/cs106.md) – Intro to Programming & Data Structures  
- [CS111](teaching/cs111.md) – Operating Systems Principles  
- [CS198B](teaching/cs198b.md) – TA training for new CS instructors
