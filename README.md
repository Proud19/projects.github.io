My academic journey is driven by a deep interest in computer systems and machine learning. | 
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|

## üìö Education  
- **Stanford University** (B.S in Computer Science, [Systems Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/bachelors-compsci-tracks-overview))
- **Stanford University** (M.S. in Computer Science, [AI Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/masters-specializations/ms-program-sheets))  

## üèóÔ∏è Projects  
I have worked on a diverse range of projects spanning **computer systems programming, AI, networking, iOS development, and web applications**.

### üîß Systems Projects  
My journey into computer systems has been both eye-opening and rewarding. My first deep dive into systems programming was through the [Cool Compiler](projects/cool-compiler.md), where I learned how computers translate human-readable code into machine-executable instructions. This was followed by an intensive experience working on [PintOS](projects/pintos.md), which provided hands-on exposure to **threads, virtual memory, and file systems**, allowing me to see how low-level components come together to form an operating system. 

I further explored networking by implementing a [TCP/IP Stack](projects/tcpip.md), which deepened my understanding of how devices communicate over networks. Seeking performance optimizations, I ventured into **parallel computing**, developing a **high-performance CUDA-based renderer**. The [CUDA Renderer](https://github.com/stanford-cs149/asst3) was particularly exciting, as it leveraged GPUs to accelerate graphics rendering, pushing computational speed to its limits.

### ü§ñ AI and ML Projects  
Building AI systems has given me a strong appreciation for the applications of computation and mathematics. One of my favorite projects was designing [an AI for GeoGuessr](projects/geoguessrai.md), one of my friend‚Äôs favorite games, using deep learning. I also built **AI agents for Catan**, applying both **deep learning** and **reinforcement learning** techniques ([Catan AI](https://github.com/Proud19/catan238)).

With the rise of **large language models**, I became curious about their optimization and real-world deployment. I contributed to research on **optimizing language models** ([MinBERT](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/default-final-project-handout-minbert-spr2024-updated.pdf)) and worked on [simulating user interactions on websites](https://github.com/Proud19/codeXwebagent) using LLMs in a hackathon project. Understanding the **ethical challenges of AI** is just as important as its capabilities, which led me to explore the **biases in AI hiring procedures** ([Algorithmic Fairness](projects/algorithmicfairness.md)) and the **alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Knowledge Graphs** ([LLM Alignment](https://medium.com/@belindamo/measuring-model-safety-through-knowledge-graphs-dcf95886404b)).

### üì± Mobile Apps and Web Development  
I enjoy building user-facing applications that blend design and functionality. For my **senior project**, my team developed **[TripSage](https://github.com/Proud19/tripsage)**, a travel companion iOS app designed to provide relevant and location-based funfacts during trips. In addition, I worked on a **photo-sharing web application** ([PhotoApp](photoapp.md)) and a **blockchain-based sustainability platform** ([GreenWise](https://github.com/ashwinirao1/greenwise)), the latter of which was developed for a **hackathon in San Francisco**.

### üé® Graphics, Animation, and Visual Modeling  
Exploring digital media has been an exciting way to combine creativity with technical problem-solving. I created an [animated short film](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qbqx57TH90jl7y9daVzISqzLC4NQjGDE/view?usp=sharing) using a blend of physical and digital tools, experimenting with **procedural animation** techniques. One of my favorite projects was designing an **orchestra room** using **ray tracing and Blender** ([Orchestra Room](projects/graphics.md)), leveraging **computer graphics principles** to achieve photorealistic rendering.

### üî¨ Research and Publications  
- **[KGGen: Extracting Knowledge Graphs from Plain Text with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09956)**
- **[Measuring Model Safety through Knowledge Graphs](https://medium.com/@belindamo/measuring-model-safety-through-knowledge-graphs-dcf95886404b)**
