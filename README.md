# 👋 Hello,

I'm Proud Mpala, a Computer Science student at Stanford University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in systems, compilers, and machine learning.

## 📚 Education  
- **Stanford University** (B.S./M.S. in Computer Science, AI Track)  
- Selected coursework: [Compilers](cs143.md), [Operating Systems](cs212.md), [Machine Learning](cs229.md), and [Computer Networking](cs144.md).  

## 🏗️ Projects  
I’ve worked on a range of projects in **systems programming, AI, and networking**. Some highlights include:  
- [**Cool Compiler**](projects/cool-compiler.md) – Built a compiler for the Cool programming language, implementing lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.  
- [**TCP/IP Stack**](projects/tcp-ip-stack.md) – Developed a functional network stack handling TCP and IP for reliable communication.  
- [**GeoguessrAI**](projects/geoguessrai.md) – Trained a CNN-KNN hybrid model to predict geographical locations from Google Street View images.  
- [More projects →](projects.md)  

## 📝 Research & Publications  
I have contributed to research on **LLM safety, adversarial optimization, and knowledge graphs**.  
- [**Measuring Model Safety through Knowledge Graphs**](publications/model-safety.md) – Developed a framework for evaluating AI model safety.  
- [**SMART for MinBERT**](publications/minbert.md) – Implemented adversarial regularization techniques to improve fine-tuning robustness.  
- [More publications →](publications.md)  

## 🎓 Teaching & Leadership  
I serve as a **Teaching Assistant & Course Assistant** for Stanford’s core CS courses:  
- [CS106A/B](teaching/cs106.md) – Intro to Programming & Data Structures  
- [CS111](teaching/cs111.md) – Operating Systems Principles  
- [CS198B](teaching/cs198b.md) – TA training for new CS instructors
