## Origin of Assets Used in the Scene

### Created from Scratch
- **3D Architecture Model:** The Gothic architectural elements, including the arches, pillars, roof, and floor, were created entirely from scratch.
- **Candles:**
  - Modeled using geometric techniques and detailed through sculpting.
  - Custom texture created for realistic candle wax appearance.
- **Stained Glass Window:**
  - Developed a custom glass material with a handcrafted texture to replicate stained glass.

### Downloaded Assets
- **Piano Model:**
  - Sourced online, but custom UV mapping was applied to modify its color and enhance realism.
- **Textures:**
  - **Pillars, Roof, and Floor:** Sourced from BlenderKit with custom modifications.
  - **Wood and Blue Fabric (Roof):** Textures obtained from BlenderKit and adjusted.
  - **Floor Material:** Acquired from BlenderKit, but refined to achieve a more natural aesthetic.
  - **Pillars:** A technique was applied to introduce coarseness, enhancing the natural texture.
