# 👋 Hello,

Computer Science student at Stanford University, specializing in Compilers and Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in systems, compilers, and machine learning.

## 📚 Education  
- **Stanford University** (B.S in Computer Science, [Systems Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/bachelors-compsci-tracks-overview))
- **Stanford University** (M.S. in Computer Science, [AI Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/masters-specializations/ms-program-sheets))  


## 🏗️ Projects  
I’ve worked on a range of projects in **systems programming, AI, and networking**. 
### Systems Projects 
Working on Computer Systems was most eye opening and yet rewarding experience. The first major system I worked on was [**Cool Compiler**](projects/cool-compiler.md) there by gaining understanding on how computers translate human readable code into machine code. I next worked on [**PintOS**](projects/cool-compiler.md) which gave me an indepth experience on building threads and a filesystem and see it all come together. 
- [**TCP/IP Stack**](projects/tcp-ip-stack.md) – Developed a functional network stack handling TCP and IP for reliable communication.  
- [**GeoguessrAI**](projects/geoguessrai.md) – Trained a CNN-KNN hybrid model to predict geographical locations from Google Street View images.

## 📝 Research & Publications  
I have contributed to research on **LLM safety, adversarial optimization, and knowledge graphs**.  
- [**Measuring Model Safety through Knowledge Graphs**](publications/model-safety.md) – Developed a framework for evaluating AI model safety.  
- [**SMART for MinBERT**](publications/minbert.md) – Implemented adversarial regularization techniques to improve fine-tuning robustness.  
- [More publications →](publications.md)  

## 🎓 Teaching & Leadership  
I serve as a **Teaching Assistant & Course Assistant** for Stanford’s core CS courses:  
- [CS106A/B](teaching/cs106.md) – Intro to Programming & Data Structures  
- [CS111](teaching/cs111.md) – Operating Systems Principles  
- [CS198B](teaching/cs198b.md) – TA training for new CS instructors
