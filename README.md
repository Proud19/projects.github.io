My academic journey is driven by a deep interest in computer systems and machine learning. | 
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|

## üìö Education  
- **Stanford University** (B.S in Computer Science, [Systems Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/bachelors-compsci-tracks-overview))
- **Stanford University** (M.S. in Computer Science, [AI Track](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/masters-specializations/ms-program-sheets))  

## üèóÔ∏è Projects  
I‚Äôve worked on a range of projects in **computer systems programming, AI, networking, iOS, and WebApps**. 
### Systems Projects 
Working on Computer Systems was most eye opening and yet rewarding experience. The first major system I worked on was [Cool Compiler](projects/cool-compiler.md) there by gaining understanding on how computers translate human readable code into machine code. I next worked on [PintOS](projects/cool-compiler.md) which gave me an indepth experience on building threads, virtual memory, filesystem and see it all come together. I also had the pleasure of imiplemeting the [TCP/IP Stack](projects/tcp-ip-stack.md) to understand how computing devices talk to each other over networks. We all do get that adrenaline rush when things go fast right, I think computers do to; I worked on making things go super fast on computers using by exploiting GPUs. Most notably [Cuda Renderer](projects/cuda-renderer.md) for fast drawing of graphics using GPU.

### AI and ML projects 
Building and learning about AI systems gave me an understanding of the recent applications of computation and mathematics. I worked on building [an AI for one of friends' favorite activities](projects/geoguessrai.md), GeoGuessr as well as various [AI agents for Catan](projects/catan.md) based on Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning techniques respectively. With the advent of language models, I decided to learn a little bit about them and ended up contributing to [optimization techniques for Language Models](projects/minbert.md) as well as using LLMs to build [an agent that simulates user interactions in websites](https://github.com/Proud19/codeXwebagent) as part of a hackathon. I found it also important to understand the harms associated with AI and ML models. This culminated in exploring potential harm in [using AI for hiring procedures](projects/algorithmic-fairness.md) as well as [analyzing the alignment of Large Language Models through Knowledge Graphs](llm-through-kg.md). 

### Mobile Apps and Web Design 
I have some experience designing and building user facing applications. For my senior project, we made a travel companion iOS app, [TripSage](tripsage.md). I have also worked on a [photosharing web application](photoapp.md) as well as a [Blockchain based web application](greenwise.md) as part of a hackathon in San Francisco. 

### Graphics, Animation and Visual Modelling 
Digital media is a very fun field to explore and I have had the opportunity to express some of my ideas in that regard. I had the pleasure of making [an animated video](projects/artstudi.md) using a blend of physical and digital tools. One of my favorite projects was using ray tracing techniques and blender to come up with [an awesome ochestra room](projects/graphics.md).
