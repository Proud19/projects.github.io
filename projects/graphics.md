# Orchestra Room using Blender

This project involved creating a 3D scene of an orchestra room using Blender. The primary goal was to design a visually compelling space that integrates Gothic architecture with artistic elements like stained glass windows, candles, and a piano. The project was a collaboration between Proud Mpala and Iddah Mlauzi, each contributing to various parts of the scene's creation and refinement.

## Contributors
- **Proud Mpala**: Lead 3D modeler for the Gothic architecture, including arches, pillars, roof, and floor.
- **Iddah Mlauzi**: Conceptualized the project, modeled the candles, created the stained glass window, and worked on lighting and layout.

## Contribution Areas

### Iddah Mlauzi
- **Project Conceptualization**: Iddah conceived the initial idea for the orchestra room scene, focusing on blending artistic Gothic design with functional interior elements. This vision guided the development of the scene layout and lighting.
- **Candles Modeling and Texturing**: Modeled multiple candles with varying heights and shapes to populate the scene. The candles were sculpted to add intricate details, and custom textures were created to give them a realistic wax appearance.
- **Lighting and Layout**: Iddah meticulously set up the lighting to create atmospheric effects, particularly focusing on how the candlelight interacts with the room and other objects. This involved adjusting the intensity and color of the lights to enhance the overall mood.
- **Stained Glass Window**: Designed and modeled a stained glass window that serves as a focal point of the scene. Iddah tested various light sources outside the window to observe how the colored light streams into the room.

### Proud Mpala
- **Gothic Architecture Model**: Proud was responsible for designing and modeling the Gothic architecture elements, including the arches, pillars, roof, and floor. Each of these elements was created from scratch using Blender's modeling tools.
- **Detailed Element Creation**: Focused on the finer architectural details, such as the texture of the pillars, arches, and roof, which required a combination of geometric modeling and texturing techniques. A custom floor texture was created to match the historical and aesthetic feel of a Gothic space.

## Origin of Assets Used in the Scene

### Created from Scratch
- **3D Architecture Model**: All major architectural components of the scene—arches, pillars, roof, and floor—were modeled from scratch using Blender's geometric and sculpting tools. These elements were designed to reflect traditional Gothic architecture, characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses.
- **Candles**:
  - Modeled using Blender's geometric primitives and sculpting tools to achieve realistic shapes. The candles feature multiple variations in length and shape, enhancing the visual interest of the scene.
  - Custom textures were created for the candle wax using UV mapping and procedural textures. This allowed for realistic wax drips and surface details.
- **Stained Glass Window**:
  - A unique glass material was developed using Blender's shader editor to simulate the translucent nature of stained glass. The material was then given a handcrafted texture to replicate the ornate designs typical of Gothic stained glass windows.
  - The window was positioned in the scene to interact with natural light sources, creating vibrant colors in the interior space.

### Downloaded Assets
- **Piano Model**:
  - The piano model was sourced online but was heavily modified to fit the scene's aesthetics. Custom UV mapping was applied to adjust the model’s texture and enhance its realism, ensuring it complemented the overall room design.
- **Textures**:
  - **Pillars, Roof, and Floor**: Textures for the pillars, roof, and floor were sourced from BlenderKit, a community-driven asset library. Custom modifications were made to these textures to integrate them seamlessly into the scene.
  - **Wood and Blue Fabric (Roof)**: Textures for the wood and fabric elements were also sourced from BlenderKit, providing a natural and tactile feel to the room’s surface details. Adjustments were made to match the architectural theme.
  - **Floor Material**: The floor texture was acquired from BlenderKit but was further refined with noise and bump mapping to create a more natural and realistic look. The final result is a stone-like floor that enhances the Gothic atmosphere.
  - **Pillars**: A custom technique was used to create a coarse, natural texture for the pillars, adding depth and realism to the stonework.

This project allowed us to explore various aspects of 3D modeling, including architectural design, realistic texturing, and lighting. The combination of original and modified assets created a cohesive and visually striking scene that highlights the potential of Blender as a tool for creating intricate environments. Through this collaboration, we were able to push the boundaries of our 3D modeling skills and create a unique interpretation of a Gothic-inspired orchestra room.
